## Odin Library

This repository contains a JavaScript library application built as part of the curriculum from The Odin Project. The project involves creating a simple user-friendly interface to manage a collection of books, including features to add, display, and manage book data efficiently.

# Features

- Add Books: Users can input details for new books (title, author, pages, and read status) using a form interface.
- Display Books: The app will dynamically display the list of added books on the web page.
- Local Storage: Persist data using local storage, ensuring that the book list remains intact even after a page refresh.
- Unique IDs for Books: Automatically assign unique IDs to each book using crypto.randomUUID(), which helps in managing the books effectively.
- Event Listeners: Add and remove event listeners to various DOM elements, enhancing user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For the structure of the application.
- CSS: For styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: For functionality, including DOM manipulation and local storage capabilities.

# Usage
